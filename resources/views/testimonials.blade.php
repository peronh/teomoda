                            <p class="mh400">Dora goes beyond just advising:  she teaches.   I learned how my clothing items can be combined in many different ways, and got on the road to dressing myself in a way that reflects my personality.  The outfits Dora put together from my wardrobe were a real revelation!  I can hardly wait to try all the possible combinations.  Thank you Dora!</p>

                            <p class="mh400">Before consulting with Dora, I had the usual difficulties when getting dressed, feeling: "I have nothing to wear, although my closet is full of clothes".<br/>
                                However, having had a personal style and body analysis, followed by a wardrobe editing consultation, now the time for getting dressed is reduced dramatically. I was given guidance as to how I should re-organize my wardrobe, how to create sets and outfits easily. During this process I also learnt how to revive some pieces that I have not really used before.</p>

                        <div class="testi_item d-flex align-items-center flex-nowrap flex-column justify-content-center">
                            <p class="mh400">I had a color consultation with Dora, and I must say I never realized which are the colors that suited me the best and which ones are the no-goes for me. But learning about my basic, neutral and statement colors make all the difference! Knowing my best colors, reduces the time I spend in clothes shops as by recognizing them I can focus really on the ones that suit me well and simply ignore the rest.</p>

                            <p class="mh400">As a man I was skeptical about having the need of a wardrobe consultant, but now I do not only know what to wear but also how to wear my clothes to be stylish and up-to-date even without having the need to buy new clothes.</p>

                            <p class="mh400">It is wonderful to learn which colors suit me best not to mention the ability to shop efficiently. Instead of searching and looking around aimlessly trying to find something which at time I wasn’t even sure about and yet purchased! Now, I am more of a savvy shopper when I enter a store and know exactly how to sort through the items. Thanks to Dora, I don’t have to buy a whole new pricey wardrobe and can utilize apparel I already have by simply being knowledgeable how to mix and match to wear them.</p>

                            <p class="mh400">I have long wanted to consult somebody about what type of clothing items were really matching my figure. Dora made me feel comfortable right from the beginning through the whole process. I learned about things like silhouettes, cuts, and fabrics that are best suitable specifically for me. I feel like a whole new person with more confidence. I am very thankful to her professional insight and highly recommend anyone who felt the way I did, to reach out to Dora for a consultation.</p>
