                            <h3>Dora Kery</h3>
                            <p class="fon">Coming from Europe with a teaching
                                background in higher education, I have always
                                had a passion for color, style, and the
                                combination of the two which represent an
                                individual’s personal image. My passion
                                continued to grow even more from the
                                experience I gained through teaching inter-
                                cultural subjects, communication, and
                                presentation skills to my students.</p>
                            <p>After marriage and becoming a mom, I
                                decided to dedicate my time learning,
                                expanding, and practicing my knowledge on the
                                theories and practical uses of color and body
                                shape analysis, wardrobe auditing and personal
                                shopping. Thus, the combination of many years
                                of teaching skill and interest in personal styling
                                lead the way into a wonderful new business path
                                for me.</p>
                            <p>With subsequent life changing events
                                few years ago that brought me to the United
                                States, my business “TeoModa” aims to reach
                                out to all individuals, who need a little
                                encouragement to gain more confidence in
                                presenting themselves with most favorable and
                                radiant ways they deserve to be while regarding
                                to their unique complexion and figure.</p>
                            <p>My motto is:</p>
                            <p>“Styling you to feel radiant, comfortable and confident, all within your budget.”</p>
                            <p>I strongly believe in the psychological power
                                behind one’s appearance and the importance of
                                knowing the right choice of colors and
                                silhouettes to wear. This enhancement will boost
                                confidence and self-esteem that are catalysts
                                needed to become more successful in life.</p>
